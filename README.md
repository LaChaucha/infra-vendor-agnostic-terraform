# infra-vendor-agnostic-terraform
Infrastructure-as-Code (Terraform) repository designed to be portable across cloud providers. It includes a networking foundation (VPC/VNet equivalents), environment segmentation (prod and nonprod), and hybrid connectivity (redundant site-to-site VPN), using a modular architecture that makes switching vendors as painless as possible.
